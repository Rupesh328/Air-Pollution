# Air Quality Prediction in Urban Areas using Machine Learning

## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement

Air pollution is a serious problem in cities, affecting health and the environment. This project aims to predict AQI (Air Quality Index) using historical data of air pollutants, weather, and traffic using machine learning models.

## ðŸ’¡ Real-Life Use Case

Delhi, one of the world's most polluted cities, used AI models to predict AQI with a 24-hour lead time. These predictions help issue warnings and reduce public exposure to pollution.

## ðŸ§  Techniques Used

- Data Preprocessing
- Feature Engineering
- Regression Algorithms (Linear Regression, Random Forest)
- Model Evaluation (RÂ² Score, MAE, RMSE)

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset

- Pollutants: PM2.5, PM10, NOâ‚‚, CO
- Weather: Temperature, Humidity, Wind Speed
- Traffic: Vehicle Count, Road Occupancy
